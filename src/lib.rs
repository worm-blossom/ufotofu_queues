//! A [trait](Queue) and implementations of non-blocking, infallible [FIFO queues](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Queue_(abstract_data_type)) that support bulk enqueueing and bulk dequeueing via APIs inspired by [ufotofu](https://crates.io/crates/ufotofu).
//!
//! ## Queue Implementations
//!
//! So far, there are two implementations:
//!
//! - [`Fixed`], which is a heap-allocated ring-buffer of unchanging capacity. It is gated behind the `std` or `alloc` feature, the prior of which is enabled by default.
//! - [`Static`], which works exactly like [`Fixed`], but is backed by an array of static capacity. It requires no allocations.
//!
//! Future plans include an elastic queue that grows and shrinks its capacity within certain parameters, to free up memory under low load.

    /// Inform the queue that `amount` many items have been written to the first `amount`
    /// indices of the `expose_slots` it has most recently exposed. The semantics must be
    /// equivalent to those of `enqueue` being called `amount` many times with exactly those

    /// #### Invariants
    ///
    /// Callers must have written into (at least) the `amount` many first `expose_slots` that
    /// were most recently exposed. Failure to uphold this invariant may cause undefined behavior.
    ///
    /// Calles must not have modified any `expose_slots` other than the first `amount` many.
    /// Failure to uphold this invariant may cause undefined behavior.
    ///
    /// #### Safety
    ///
    /// The queue implementation may assume the first `amount` many `expose_slots` that were most recently
    /// exposed to contain initialized memory after this call, even if the memory it exposed was
    /// originally uninitialized. Violating the invariants can cause the queue to read undefined
    /// memory, which triggers undefined behavior.
    ///
    /// Further, the queue implementation my assume any `expose_slots` slots beyond the first `amount` many
    /// to remain unchanged. In particular, the implementation may assume that those slots have *not*
    /// been set to [`MaybeUninit::uninit`].
